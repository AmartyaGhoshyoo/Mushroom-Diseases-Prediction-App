  {
    question: 'What is the shelf life of mushroom?',
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: 'What is the role of CO2 in mushroom growth?',
    answer:
      'Carbon dioxide level control is critical for mushroom growth. CO2 levels between 10,000 - 20,000 ppm during the spawn run but no more than 1,000 ppm during the fruiting phase, preferably between 500 and 800 ppm is suggested. If CO2 concentrations are higher than 1,000 ppm during fruiting, yields will decrease. In addition, carbon dioxide monitoring is especially important during pinning. Mushrooms pin under high CO2 levels, extending their stems to find oxygen. Too much CO2 as the pins grow results in "legging" or long stems, as the developing fruit pushes higher in the air to search for oxygen.',
